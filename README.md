# Password Generator (JavaScript)
An application that generates a password using vanilla JavaScript 💛

I created an application that a user can then use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
